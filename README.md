# 6502 Emulator in Java

This project is an emulator for the **6502 microprocessor**, written in Java. It simulates the behavior of the 6502 CPU, its instructions, memory, and registers, allowing you to run assembly programs on a virtual machine. The goal of this emulator is to replicate the behavior of the 6502 processor as accurately as possible, enabling the execution of vintage software or providing a platform for educational purposes and research.

## Features

- Emulates the **6502 CPU** with its registers (A, X, Y, SP, PC, Status flags).

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/6502-emulator.git
   cd 6502-emulator
   ```

2. **Build the project** (if necessary):
   - If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, you can simply open the project.
   - Alternatively, you can build the project manually by compiling all `.java` files:
     ```bash
     javac *.java
     ```

3. **Run the Emulator**:
   To run the emulator and execute a program (e.g., a 6502 assembly binary file), run the following command:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

4. **Running Programs**:
   Not Yet Implimented

## Usage

### Instructions and Addressing Modes

Not Yet bro

### Flags

The 6502 has a set of **status flags** that affect the behavior of the processor:
- **Carry (C)**: Set or cleared during arithmetic operations.
- **Zero (Z)**: Set when the result of an operation is zero.
- **Interrupt Disable (I)**: Prevents IRQ interrupts.
- **Decimal (D)**: Used in BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) mode.
- **Break (B)**: Indicates a software interrupt (BRK instruction).
- **Overflow (V)**: Set if an arithmetic overflow occurs.
- **Negative (N)**: Set if the result is negative.
